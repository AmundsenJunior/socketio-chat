# socketio-chat
NodeJS and Socket.IO chat application, from the [Socket.IO "Getting Started" page](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

## Install and Run

Clone the repo, and move into the directory:

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/AmundsenJunior/socketio-chat.git
  $ cd socketio-chat
```

```.gitignore``` keeps ```node_modules/``` out of the repo. If you have NodeJS and NPM already installed, install the Node package dependencies listed in ```package.json```. They are ExpressJS and Socket.IO in this case:

```
  $ npm install
```

Run the application from the command line with:

```
  $ node server.js
```

Open multiple tabs or windows of your browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:3000/``` to test the application.
